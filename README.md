  Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) refer to the study of methods for organizing and storing data and the design of procedures (algorithms) for solving problems, which operate on these data structures. DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer science student must have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant, including companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook (now Meta). This DSA tutorial aims to help you learn Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) quickly and easily.
